for NDPI images

I am using the WINE envirommnet to make our lives easier
These commands worked from my Ubuntu 10.04LTS 64 bit system

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa
sudo apt-get install wine
sudo apt-get install winetricks

this will install the runtimes needed so that the application actually runs..
winetricks vcrun2008 dotnet35
  

Notes: 

 'winetricks list-installed' will tell you what packages you already have installed
  

 

Running Utility:

  
wine NDPIUtilities.exe [somescript.txt]
  
the script file has two "modes"
9:08 AM 
you can either "tile" or thumb
  
thumb will get you a layer--- but if it's bigger than 65Kx65K it chokes (bigtiff--> tiff problem)
  
but basically something like
  
tile /data2/dgutman/TARUN_SLIDES/Training_Slides/HD-1.ndpi /data3/TILE_CACHE/ADRC/TRAINING_SLIDES/HD-1 4096 40
9:09 AM 
tile <input_ndpi> <output_dir> <tilesize> <res>
  
so the above example will tile the file at 40X resolution
  
into 4K x 4K chunks
